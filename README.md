This project is pushed to my secondary, not public github account.

P.S. A little bit strange react task, expected for more complex state, lifecycle methods, hooks, redux, etc. :), nonetheless I tried to make each component reusable as much as needed. 

P.S. P.S. I forgot to iniate git and I had a git folder in upper directories so my commits went not where I wanted... My mistake :)
